/* node test/cron.lock.test.js — G4.3: cross-process / reentrancy exactly-once cron lock.

   Proves cron fires EXACTLY ONCE even when two sidecars (or a boot-reconcile racing the first
   timer tick, or a CRUD save racing an advance) hit the schedule at the same instant. All headless
   with injected fs/clock/nonce — no real timer, no wall-clock or rng read in the logic under test
   (lint-determinism stays green: the lock module takes now()+nonce as injected deps).

   Three load-bearing properties, each red on the pre-fix tree:

     · IN-PROCESS REENTRANCY (tickInFlight): two back-to-back applyTick at the SAME instant produce
       a SINGLE cron.fire — a re-entrant tick is a no-op, never a second launch.

     · STALE-RECLAIM RACE (the TOCTOU bug the file lock exists to prevent): a STALE lockfile (mtime
       older than maxRunMs) is reclaimed by exactly ONE of two distinct holders racing at the same
       now. Reclaim is a SINGLE atomic step (rename the stale lockfile to a holder-stamped name);
       the LOSER of the rename gets ENOENT and NO-OPS. Two applyTick passes over the SAME on-disk
       store, each guarded by a distinct lock holder, fire EXACTLY ONCE TOTAL. An in-process-only
       guard does NOT satisfy this — both holders exercise the real file-lock reclaim path.

     · CRUD SERIALIZATION (re-read-modify-write under the lock): a concurrent CRUD setJobs cannot
       clobber an in-flight advance. The lock serializes the two writers and the CRUD write re-reads
       the freshest on-disk store before applying its delta, so the advanced nextRunAt survives.

   The lock module (sidecar/cron-lock.js) is the testable seam, exactly like durable-write.js — it
   is importable and exercises the REAL acquire/reclaim/release path against a real temp dir. */
