/* test/capdrift.test.js — guards the prop⇄capability seam against silent drift.
   Three parallel structures describe "what a placed prop grants": the PropSprites CATALOG
   (what the palette sells), WorldModel.CAP_PROP_MAP (what the station projects to the sidecar),
   and CAP_REGISTRY (what resolveTools actually grants). A prop present in one but missing from
   the next fails SILENTLY in the live app — the palette promises a power the run never gets.
   This test makes that drift fail HERE instead. */
