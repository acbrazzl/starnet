/* node test/crew-rail-fit.test.js — the CREW rail's roster window always ends flush under a row.

   Reported 2026-08-07: the roster "cuts off" — the last agent rendered sliced in half. Cause: the
   window was a flat `max-height: 40%` of the column, and a percentage of a column is never a whole
   number of rows. Measured on a 6-agent station that left 10px of a row hanging at 1440x900, 18px
   at 780 and 25px at 660 — enough that the list reads as broken rather than as scrollable.

   The fix measures the window from real row geometry and rounds DOWN to a whole row. crewCap is
   that decision, split out from the measuring so it is genuinely unit-testable; the measuring
   itself needs a layout engine (offsetTop/offsetHeight read 0 under jsdom) and is source-locked
   here instead.

   OUT OF HEADLESS SCOPE: the on-screen result — rows whole, nothing sliced, scroll reaching the
   last agent, and the same under a WORKING row and at 85%/130% TEXT SIZE — is covered live by
   dev/crew-fit-probe.mjs and dev/crew-fit-stress.mjs. */
