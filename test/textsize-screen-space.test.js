/* textsize-screen-space.test.js — THE "TEXT SIZE is a type dial, not a magnifying glass" gate.
 *
 * Two reports from Andrew, one root cause. TEXT SIZE is a `zoom` on <body> (stationui.js
 * applySettings) and zoom multiplies into EVERY descendant length, so it scaled things that are
 * HARDWARE rather than content:
 *   2026-08-02, the tube: "it kind of ruins the look… enlarges it in a strange way." The glass
 *     overlay's beam pitch is authored in hard px, so it stretched with the text — measured live at
 *     1440x900, a 3px pitch rendered at 3.45 / 3.90 / 4.35px at LARGE / X-LARGE / HUGE.
 *   2026-08-03, the cabinet: measured live at 1911x935, the crew rail went 232→336px and COMMS
 *     360→522px, which squeezed the station view 1279→995px — asking for bigger text made the thing
 *     you actually watch 29% SMALLER, while the nameplates, the baked logo, the dock and every
 *     corner radius inflated 45%.
 *
 * The law: the tube and the cabinet are HARDWARE — they sit in front of and around the picture,
 * they are not part of it. Only what you READ scales. stationui publishes `--sn-unzoom` (the exact
 * reciprocal of the zoom it applies); `body` binds it to `--cz`, and every hardware length is
 * written `calc(<designed>px * var(--cz))` so it lands back at the size it was drawn at.
 *
 * Guarded here, because each is one careless edit away:
 *   1. the reciprocal stops being published (or stops being removed at 100%) -> everything stretches
 *      again, or 100% stops being the untouched shipped default;
 *   2. a gradient re-tune drops `* var(--cz)` off one stop -> that stop stretches while its
 *      neighbours don't, which is worse than the original bug;
 *   3. a cabinet dimension gets written as a bare px -> the frame starts eating the station again;
 *   4. something inside a counter-zoomed block positions itself with U.uiZoom() -> it lands off by
 *      the zoom factor, because the cabinet's local frame is visual px while <body> is zoomed.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT guarded: the VALUES. Stop alphas, radii, rail widths are a look — tuned in
 * crtlab and by eye — and this gate must not freeze the look, only the screen-space property of it.

 * of a modal sat OFF the glass, so the bay could not be used or closed without going back to
 * STANDARD first. Measured live at 1440x900 before the fix, `.mkt` box vs the real viewport:
 *     100% 1180x828 fits · 115% 1357x952 (±26) · 130% 1440x1076 (±88) · 145% 1440x1201 (±150)
 * and the ✕ at top:-4 / -63 / -122. 115% is what AUTO picks on a <=1470px laptop, so this was
 * the DEFAULT on a small screen. One cause, several surfaces: `92vh` inside the body zoom is not
 * 92% of the glass — the viewport unit resolves against the REAL viewport and is THEN multiplied
 * by the zoom, so it renders as 133vh at HUGE. The same bare cap was on the COMMS lightbox
 * (measured ±5 / ±65 / ±124 with an oversized image).
 *
 * A frame gets ONE of two treatments, and this gate accepts either:
 *   · it is a child of a `position:fixed; inset:0` layer (a scrim, `.screen`) — that layer is
 *     viewport-exact under zoom (probed: 1440x900 at every scale), so a PERCENTAGE of it is the
 *     glass in the frame's own zoomed coordinate space. Preferred: no reciprocal to forget.
 *   · it is a body-level fixed panel with nothing to be a percentage of — then every viewport
 *     cap is written `calc(<n>vh * var(--sn-unzoom, 1))`, like `.term` above.
 * What is FORBIDDEN either way is a bare vw/vh cap, which is not a cap at all above 100%.
