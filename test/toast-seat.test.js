/* toast-seat.test.js — WHERE THE TOAST RACK IS BOLTED.
 *
 * The bug (Andrew, 2026-08-15: "EXTREMELY ugly, will phase through windows, is not aligned
 * correctly"): #toast-stack was pinned by two literal numbers — `left: 268px * --cz` and
 * `bottom: 128px * --cz` — that lined up with nothing. Measured live at 1440x900: the columns
 * run x 11→1429 and end at y 836, so the rack floated 257px right of the cabinet's left edge and
 * 64px above the floor line, in the middle of the stage tube where every floating window is
 * centred. And because the CREW seam is DRAGGABLE (--crew-w, leftrail.js), a wide rail walked the
 * stage out from under the rack and the card ended up sitting ON the crew list.
 *
 * The fix is a MEASURED seat (StationUI.seatToastRack, the syncTermBand idiom): read the real
 * cabinet rects, divide by the TEXT SIZE zoom exactly once, publish --toast-x / --toast-b /
 * --toast-cap. This test locks both halves so neither can quietly regress to arithmetic:
 *   1. the sheet consumes the vars and carries no hard-coded anchor for the rack
 *   2. the positioner exists, measures the chrome, converts once, and runs at both the moments
 *      that matter (a card being emitted, and the frame being resized)
 * Proof harness + before/after renders: dev/toast-seat-shots.mjs.
