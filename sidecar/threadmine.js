/* sidecar/threadmine.js — the PURE post-run THREAD-MINING producer (NS-6). Given a finished run's conversation +
   an INJECTED aux-model `propose(prompt) -> text`, it asks "which ideas did the Commander float here but never
   act on?", parses the model's tagged blocks into thread candidates, and guardrails them (a VERBATIM evidence
   quote that must actually appear in the conversation — the grounding veto; fingerprint dedup vs the live ledger
   AND the permanent declined denylist; length + count caps). The turn-in beat then offers Keep / Edit / Discard.

   Mirrors reflect.js / study.js exactly: NO IO, NO ambient clock/rng — `clock`, `propose` are injected, so it is
   deterministic and replay-safe (passes lint-determinism). Candidates are CANDIDATES ONLY: this module NEVER
   writes to the ledger. Nothing becomes an open thread until the Commander keeps it at turn-in (index.js turn-in
   route → threadsStore.add). That is the "stash, not auto-commit" law, ported from the memory/study turn-in.

   THE GROUNDING VETO (the anti-slop heart, ported from autopilot.parseCandidates): a thread is only as real as its
   evidence. The model must return a VERBATIM quote of where the Commander raised the idea; a candidate whose quote
   does NOT appear (normalized) in the actual conversation is DROPPED. An idea the model invented — "the user
   wanted a CRM" when they never said it — has no real quote, so it dies. This is what keeps "you mentioned X" honest.

   THE SUBSTANCE VETO (added after the 2026-07-08 escape: real-provider mining offered a banter line — "I'm gonna be
   throwing some real chaos at you" — back as a "thread", which is exactly the ridiculous ask that erodes trust in
   the whole turn-in surface): grounded is NOT enough. A thread must also be actionable work: the model must supply
   a DO: line naming a concrete first deliverable AND stake CONFIDENCE: high that the Commander genuinely wants it
   picked up; anything less is dropped. The prompt states the bar explicitly ("would being asked about this seem
   ridiculous?") with banter/hype/jokes as named non-examples, caps the list at 2, and defaults to NONE. */
