/* sidecar/usercommands.js — COMMANDER-DEFINED slash commands.

   Lets the Commander add their own commands without touching code, in the shape the reference harness proved
   (© 2025 Nous Research, MIT — see NOTICE.md; its `quick_commands` config block has the same two types):

     alias — "/standup" runs "/routine list". Pure rewrite; the target is re-resolved through the registry,
             so an alias can never reach anything the Commander could not have typed themselves.
     exec  — "/disk" runs a shell snippet and prints its output.

   WHY THE FILE LIVES OUTSIDE THE AGENT JAIL. The reference harness's safety argument for shell-typed commands
   is that they are "user-defined shell snippets from config.yaml — not agent/LLM controlled". That argument
   only holds while an agent cannot author them, so this store sits beside the channel secrets in WORKSPACES
   root — NOT under WORKSPACES/<agentId>/ — where the fs jail keeps every agent's own tools out. If these ever
   move inside a jail, exec becomes a prompt-injection vector and must be disabled with them.

   Pure + injected fs so it is testable without touching a disk. */

   a group can tap them instead of having to know them (2026-10-18: the menu listed 0 of them).
     · Telegram's grammar is a-z0-9_ (1-32): '-' becomes '_' (the hub reads "/disk_usage" back as /disk-usage), and
       a name over 32 characters stays typeable but is not listed.
     · `reserved` = every name a built-in owns (the hub's table + the slash registry's builtins and aliases). A
       built-in always wins that name, so listing a user command under it would advertise something that never runs.
     · A dashed name whose '_' form is ANOTHER command's exact name is not listed: the hub runs the exact name, so
       the row would carry one command's description and run the other.
