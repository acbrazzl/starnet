/* sidecar/skills/gate.js - WHO MAY READ a saved skill.

   skillstore.persist() has always scanned every skill through skills/guard.js and stamped the
   verdict on the record as `guardAction` ('allow' | 'ask' | 'block'). Nothing consumed it: a
   skill the scanner called dangerous was still indexed into the system prompt, still preloaded
   by /skill, and still returned in full by skill.view. This module is the consumer — the one
   place that answers "may the MODEL see this?".

   Three rules, and they are deliberately not symmetric:
     block -> never visible, and NOT approvable. `block` is the trust table's answer for content
              a TRUSTED source should never have written (skills/guard.js TRUST); a click cannot
              make it safe, and offering the click would just train the Commander to click.
     ask   -> withheld until the Commander approves THIS EXACT CONTENT. The approval is keyed to
              a content digest, mirroring plugins.js keying its allowlist to the code hash: an
              edit re-asks, exactly like a silently edited plugin re-asks.
     other -> visible.

   A withheld skill is still LISTED (name + reason, never its summary — the summary is
   model-authored text the scanner never covered). Hiding the row outright would make the model
   try to create a same-named skill, which manage() then refuses as a duplicate: a silent gate
   that manufactures a confusing refusal two turns later. Truthful telemetry applies to the
   prompt too — say the skill exists and say it is withheld.

   Pure and dependency-injected: `approvals` is a lookup the sidecar owns (a JSON file under
   WORKSPACES), `guard` is skills/guard.js. Nothing here touches the filesystem.
