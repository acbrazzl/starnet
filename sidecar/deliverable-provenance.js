/* sidecar/deliverable-provenance.js — WHO made a deliverable, and WHAT it belongs to.

   Both answers are DERIVED from the append-only run log, never stored on the deliverable and never authored by a
   model. That split is the whole point: a card's prose (title/summary) comes from the agent, but its attribution
   and its project come from harness truth, so the card can never claim a collaborator or a folder the run log
   can't back.

   Two derivations, one index:

   - projectOf(runId)      -> the blessed project folder the work was scoped to, or '' when unscoped. A DELEGATED
                              worker carries no projectRoot of its own (team.dispatch threads parentRunId, not the
                              project), so this walks up the parent chain to the lead rather than filing a worker's
                              output as unscoped. The walk is depth-bounded: a corrupt log with a parent cycle must
                              not hang the library.
   - contributorsOf(runId) -> [{ agentId, role:'lead'|'worker', identityFallback }] — the lead run plus every
                              non-internal child run that named a different agent. Deduped by agentId (three
                              dispatches to the same specialist is one contributor), lead always first.
                              `identityFallback` rides along because a run that fell back to the station persona
                              was NOT the named specialist — the UI has to be able to say so.

   PURE: given rows in, answers out. No ambient IO/time, so it unit-tests headlessly. `isInternal` is injected
   because "which streams are internal harness self-talk" is the caller's knowledge (contextpack), not ours. */
