# Remembered update bypasses retry backoff after a failed native check

## Symptom

After StarNet remembers an available update and restarts, a failed native check repeats every second despite a stored exponential retry deadline. Restarting repeats the requests again.

## Repro

Run `node qa/evidence/deep-sweep-2026-10-11/update-backoff-live.mjs before` on a20ffa71f. The fixture starts an isolated seeded sidecar and real Chromium, remembers an available version, and makes only the native updater IPC fail. Observe automatic checks, manual CHECK NOW, and a page restart. The production planner regression is `test/updatecore.test.js`; the production UI scheduling regression is `test/update-center-truth.test.js`.

## Evidence

Committed receipts: `qa/evidence/deep-sweep-2026-10-11/update-backoff-before.json` shows three automatic calls within 3.3 seconds and two more after restart. `qa/evidence/deep-sweep-2026-10-11/update-backoff-after.json` shows one initial check, an immediate manual second check, no automatic call after restart, and zero browser exceptions. Before the repair, 15 planner and 5 UI assertions failed; after, updatecore107, update-center-truth28, and updates-install34 assertions passed.

## Verdict

Verified in the running seeded app and real Chromium with failed updater IPC only. This proves retry scheduling, persistence, and manual checks; it does not claim an installed binary or signed upgrade test.
